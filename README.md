Master Thesis of Beno√Æt Richard, done in 2018 in the University of Fribourg.

It is made public here to allow easy access to the code and to share it as an example of the use the Julia packages [`IntervalArithmetic.jl`]() and [`IntervalRootFinding.jl`]().

The code is available under MIT license, while the report and all plots are published under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), for compatibility with license of the [Konect database](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/) which was use for the creation of several plots.

Note that despite being made available here, most of the code will not work out of the box, even if you have all of the (numerous) dependencies installed. Possible reasons of failure include:
  - My `startup.jl` file add the `src/` folder to the `LOADPATH`.
  - The source data for real networks are not included in this repo, they can be retrieved in the [Konect database](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/), though.
  - Some file requires to run other files first to generate the needed data (typically all most files in the `Plot generation` folder do).
  - The working directory must be the root directory of this repo.
  - This is a gigantic mess and I may have inadvertently left behind some broken files.
